= Securing Spring Boot applications with SSL/TLS
:toc:

This repository contains a sample of configuring Spring Boot client and server applications and a Redis server to use SSL/TLS for two-way (mutual) authentication.

== Architecture

There are two applications named `books-server` and `books-client` in this sample, each in their own modules.

The server application is a web server providing a REST endpoint `/api/books` that returns a list of books from Redis using Spring Data Redis.

The client application configures a `RestTemplate`, a `RestClient`, and a `WebClient` for communicating with the server.
This is done to show the SSL configuration for both types of REST clients.
Each REST client is used to call the server endpoint and print the results to `stdout`.

=== Docker Compose

When running the server application locally, a Redis server will be started automatically using {spring-boot-docs}/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.docker-compose[Spring Boot's support for Docker Compose].

The included link:books-server/docker-compose.yml[Docker Compose file] uses https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/[Docker Compose profiles] to start the Redis server without or with SSL configuration using `default` and `ssl` profiles.
Docker Compose profiles are similar to Spring Boot profiles, but they work independently of each other.

=== SSL Bundles

Secure SSL connections are configured for communication between the server application and Redis, and between the client and server applications.
In the Spring Boot applications, this is done using the {spring-boot-docs}/reference/features/ssl.html[SSL bundles feature] to load and apply PEM certificates.

For the `books-server` application, SSL bundles are defined and applied using link:books-server/src/main/resources/application.yml[properties in the `application.yml` file] to configure the Redis client connection and the web server.
The web server is also configured to require client authentication.

For the `books-client` application, an SSL bundle is defined using link:books-client/src/main/resources/application.yml[properties in the `application.yml` file] and applied by customizing the link:books-client/src/main/java/org/example/books/client/RestTemplateConfiguration.java[`RestTemplate`], link:books-client/src/main/java/org/example/books/client/RestClientConfiguration.java[`RestClient`], and link:books-client/src/main/java/org/example/books/client/WebClientConfiguration.java[`WebClient`] using Spring Boot APIs.

== Running the Sample Locally Without SSL

The sample can be run without any SSL authentication to make sure everything is working in the simplest configuration.

First, start the `books-server` application and the Redis database:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :books-server:bootRun
----

When the server application is running and ready to accept connections, it should display log messages containing text similar to this example:

[source]
----
...
... o.s.b.d.c.l.DockerComposeLifecycleManager : Using Docker Compose file '/home/user/projects/spring-boot-ssl-demo/books-server/docker-compose.yml'
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Creating
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Created
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Starting
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Started
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Waiting
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis  Healthy
...
... o.example.books.server.BooksApplication  : Started BooksApplication in 2.0 seconds (process running for 2.2)
----

NOTE: If the server application is run using any other means (such as an IDE), make sure that the current working directory is the directory containing the `books-server/docker-compose.yml` file so that the Redis server is started automatically.

Next, run the `books-client` application:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :books-client:bootRun
----

The client application should start, with output similar to the following:

[source]
----
Attempting to connect to server with RestTemplate

Successfully connected to server with RestTemplate and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...

Attempting to connect to server with RestClient

Successfully connected to server with RestClient and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...

Attempting to connect to server with WebClient

Successfully connected to server with WebClient and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...
----

The list of books from the server can be viewed as JSON at `http://localhost:8080/books` or as an HTML page at `http://localhost:8080`.

== Running the Sample Locally With SSL

When running these samples locally, the https://www.openssl.org/[`openssl` toolkit] will be used to generate certificates using a self-signed certificate authority.
`openssl` must be installed before following the instructions below.

First, generate a root certificate authority and a set of certificates from the CA.
The Redis server, `books-server` application, and `books-client` application will each get their own certificates that identify them to the other components that they need to communicate with.

[source,bash]
----
scripts/create-certs.sh
----

Next, start the `books-server` application and the Redis database with a Spring Boot profile that modifies the Spring Boot application configuration and the Docker Compose configuration for Redis:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :books-server:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=ssl'
----

When the server application is running and ready to accept connections, it should display log messages containing text similar to this example:

[source]
----
...
... o.s.b.d.c.l.DockerComposeLifecycleManager : Using Docker Compose file '/home/user/projects/spring-boot-ssl-demo/books-server/docker-compose.yml'
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Creating
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Created
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Starting
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Started
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Waiting
... o.s.boot.docker.compose.core.DockerCli   :  Container redis-ssl  Healthy
...
... o.example.books.server.BooksApplication  : Started BooksApplication in 2.0 seconds (process running for 2.2)
----

NOTE: If the server application is run using any other means (such as an IDE), make sure that the current working directory is the directory containing the `books-server/docker-compose.yml` file so that the Redis server is started automatically.

Next, run the `books-client` application with the same Spring Boot profile:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :books-client:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=ssl'
----

The client application should start, with output similar to the following:

[source]
----
Attempting to connect to server with RestTemplate

Successfully connected to server with RestTemplate and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...

Attempting to connect to server with RestClient

Successfully connected to server with RestClient and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...

Attempting to connect to server with WebClient

Successfully connected to server with WebClient and received response:
Book[...]
Book[...]
...
----

The list of books from the server can be viewed as JSON at `http://localhost:8080/books` or as an HTML page at `http://localhost:8080`.
